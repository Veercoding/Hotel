<P>Camel riding is not a very common activity offered by hotels in Punjab, India as camels are not as prevalent in this region compared to the desert states of Rajasthan. However, here are a few options where you may be able to experience camel rides in Punjab:
    <br><br>
    1. Harike Wetland and Bird Sanctuary
    This wetland near Amritsar has some operators that offer camel safaris to explore the marshy landscape and spot migratory birds. Some resorts in the area can arrange this activity.
    <br><br> 
    2. Rural Village Experiences
    A few heritage hotels or rural tourism initiatives in villages of Punjab provide guests with a taste of village life which may include a short camel cart ride through the countryside.
    <br><br>
    3. Outskirts of Major Cities
    On the outskirts of cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar or Ludhiana, you might find independent operators offering camel joy rides, especially during local festivals or melas.
    <br><br>
    4. Desert Camp Experiences
    While not exactly in Punjab, luxury desert camps in the Thar desert areas near the Punjab-Rajasthan border sometimes offer camel safaris over the sand dunes as an experience.</P>
